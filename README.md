## DOWNLOAD
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker/releases/latest).\
Please be aware that Linux (.gz) and macOS (.zip) versions are not thoroughly tested.

## USAGE
Place **CurseBreaker** binary inside directory containing `Wow.exe`, `WowClassic.exe` or `World of Warcraft.app`.\
Read the instructions on the top of the screen.

Already installed addons will not be recognized by **CurseBreaker** and they need to be reinstalled.\
This process can be partially automated by using the `import` command.

Both _Retail_ and _Classic_ clients are supported. The client version is detected automatically.\
By default **CurseBreaker** will create backups of entire `WTF` directory.

## TIPS & TRICKS
- On Windows command `uri_integration` can be used to enable integration with the CurseForge page.
- Most of the commands support the space-separated list of addons.
- `install` command have optional `-i` flag that can be used to disable client version check.
- TUI will look a little better if the application is started by something else than the default Windows command prompt. [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is recommended.
- Environment variable `CURSEBREAKER_PATH` can be used to set the custom location of WoW client.
- When the application is started with a `headless` parameter entire addon and WA upgrade process plus WTF backup should be executed in the background. Log file _CurseBreaker.html_ will be created in the same directory as the application.

- Wago: **CurseBreaker** can update auras and Plater profiles/scripts like WeakAuras Companion.

## WEAKAURAS SUPPORT
**CurseBreaker** by default will try to update all detected WeakAuras and Plater profiles/scripts. Process work the same as WeakAuras Companion.\
All updates will still need to be applied in-game in the WeakAuras/Plater option menu.\
Command `toggle_wa` can be used to set a single author name that will be ignored during the update.\
Additionally Wago API key can be set with `set_wa_api` command so non-public entries will also be upgradeable.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Using "double" WoWInterface projects ([example](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5086-BigWigsBossmods)) will always install a retail version of the addon. It can't be fixed as WoWInterface API doesn't support this type of project.
- WoWInterface projects that need to install files outside the `Interface\AddOns` directory are not supported.
